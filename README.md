====================

A Qt plugin for SQLite encryption for use in the **[TaskGuard](https://github.com/mxrcode/TaskGuard)** project *(Qt 6.8.0, sqlite3mc 1.9.0)*

Based on the SQLite source and wxSQLite3 in wxWidget.

Qt is a complete development framework with tools designed to streamline the creation of applications and user interfaces for desktop, embedded and mobile platforms. More details can be found at https://www.qt.io.

SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely used SQL database engine in the world. The SQLite source code is in the public domain. More details can be found at http://www.sqlite.org/.

wxSQLite3 is a C++ wrapper around the public domain SQLite 3.x database and is specifically designed for use in applications based on the wxWidgets library. wxSQLite3 includes an optional extension to SQLite that supports key-based encryption of database files using 128-bit AES encryption. More details can be found at http://utelle.github.io/wxsqlite3. wxSQLite3 is released under the wxWindows Library Licence.
